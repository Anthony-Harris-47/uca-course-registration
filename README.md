# UCA Course Registration â€“ Baseline (for Refactoring Assignment)

This is a runnable but intentionally messy Java CLI app.  
Your assignment: **Refactor** into clean layers (model, repo, service, ui).  
Preserve existing behaviors: students, courses, enrollments, waitlists, drops.

## Run
```bash
mvn clean package 
java -jar target/course-registration-0.1.0.jar
java -jar target/course-registration-0.1.0.jar --demo
```
